Created by Athul N A
🚀 Project Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application that features two intelligent AI agents, built as part of the AI Kyro Internship Assignment.

🔹 Agents Included:
🧑‍💼 Customer Support Agent
Displays a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and allows users to click on each to view answers in an accordion-style layout.

🧬 Genetic Wellness Agent
Uses the Google Gemini API to answer user-submitted health and genetics-related questions in real-time.

🖼️ How It Works
When you launch the app:

The homepage appears with two modern, clickable cards—one for each agent.

Clicking on:

Customer Support Agent takes you to a page showing all questions from faqs.json. Clicking any question expands its answer.

Genetic Wellness Agent leads to a form where you can ask questions. Answers are generated by Gemini AI.

Every page includes a clean UI and a back button for easy navigation.

🧪 Testing the Agents
✅ What I Tested
Agent	Example Query	Expected Outcome
Customer Support Agent	"How can I reset my password?"	Shows matching answer from faqs.json.
Genetic Wellness Agent	"What are the benefits of DNA testing?"	Responds with a generative answer via Gemini AI.
Invalid Query (FAQ)	"Do you ship internationally?"	Displays fallback message.
Invalid Query (Wellness)	"asdf1234"	Gemini handles gracefully or returns an error.

🧪 How I Validated
Tested interactions on desktop and mobile view.

Checked proper routing and transitions between pages.

Verified error handling in case of unknown inputs or API issues.

🧠 AI Tools Used
ChatGPT (GPT-4o) – Used for brainstorming architecture, debugging, and UI improvements.

Google Gemini API – Provides generative responses for the Genetic Wellness Agent.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Flask) – Backend framework

HTML/CSS (Vanilla + Responsive) – Frontend structure and styling

JavaScript – For interactivity (accordion and AJAX)

Google Generative AI API – For answering genetics-related questions

dotenv – For securely managing API keys
